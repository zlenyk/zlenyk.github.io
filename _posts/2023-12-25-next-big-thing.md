Convolutions vs Transformers. Large-scale-pretraining vs self-supervised training vs foundation models.
In the last 10 years we made a leap in computer vision. We basically solved classification. We are close to having perfect dense prediction tasks (2d detection, 2d segmentation). We are making reasonable progress in 3d object detection and segmentation from point clouds.

What will computer vision look like in 2030? Are there papers that are not getting enough attention (no pun intended) but are actually the future of CV, even if something is holding back their results?
What will be the dominant architecture and dominant training style?

The real question: what will be the problem that vision will be solving in 2030? Classification, detection, segmentation, or general "understanding"?
