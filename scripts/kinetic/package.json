Please continue to file any issues that you may find, or submit pull requests.  They will eventually be addressed.\n\n#Installation\n\n* `bower install kineticjs`\n* `npm install kinetic` - for Browserify. For nodejs you have to install some [dependencies](#NodeJS)\n\n###NodeJS\n\nSupport of NodeJS is experimental.\n\nWe are using [node-canvas](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas) to create canvas element.\n\n1. Install node-canvas [https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages)\n2. `npm install jsdom`\n3. `npm install kinetic`\n\nSee file `nodejs-demo.js` for example.\n\n#Dev environment\n\nBefore doing all dev stuff make sure you have node installed. After that, run `npm install --dev` in the main directory to install the node module dependencies.\n\nRun `grunt --help` to see all build options.\n\n##Building the KineticJS Framework \n\nTo build a development version of the framework, run `grunt dev`. To run a full build, which also produces the minified version and the individually minified modules for the custom build, run `grunt full`.  You can also run `grunt beta` to generate a beta version.   \n\nIf you add a file in the src directory, be sure to add the filename to the sourceFiles array variable in Gruntfile.js.\n\n##Testing\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericdrowell/KineticJS.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ericdrowell/KineticJS)\n\nKineticJS uses Mocha for testing. \n\n* If you need run test only one time run `grunt test`.\n* While developing it is easy to use `grunt server` with watch task. Just run it and go to [http://localhost:8080/test/runner.html](http://localhost:8080/test/runner.html). After src file change kinetic-dev.js will be automatically created, so you just need refresh test the page.\n\nKineticJS is covered with hundreds of tests and well over a thousand assertions.  KineticJS uses TDD (test driven development) which means that every new feature or bug fix is accompanied with at least one new test. \n\n##Generation documentation\n\nRun `grunt docs` which will build the documentation files and place them in the docs folder.\n\n\n#Pull Requests\nI'd be happy to review any pull requests that may better the KineticJS project, in particular if you have a bug fix, enhancement, or a new shape (see `src/shapes` for examples).  Before doing so, please first make sure that all of the tests pass (`grunt test`). \n",
